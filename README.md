The AirBnB project is a suite projects focused on building a functional copy of AirBnB website.

AirBnB is an online marketplace for short- and long-term homestays and experiences.

The application will be developed through six iterations - representing each sub-projects - starting with the console.

The AirBnb console is aimed at building a file storage engine to persist CRUD data model, validated by the interactive console.

While the initial choice of storage was a file-based storage type (JSON), the current project (AirBnB clone - MySQL) will integrate MySQL database storage and employ SQLAlchemy as an Object Relational Mapper for the required tasks.
